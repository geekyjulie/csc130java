CSC130 Scientific Programming
Final Project Outline
→ Assignment Checker

1) This program gets the information about courses that user is taking
2) Store the course information as an array
3) User can check for the submission
4) User can print out what courses she/he is taking
5) User can check out what tasks need to be done

Input: Course title, number of tasks, task name, due dates and checking
Output: A table of the information

// A common task for the each course 
   It will be used in Assignment Checker java program as an each element.
CourseWork.java

Declare Public Class CourseWork
{
	Declare Private String courseName
	Declare String[] taskName 
	Declare Integer numOfTask
	Declare String[] dueDate

	// Contructor: It sets course name, a size of taskName and duedate array
	Declare Public CourseWork(String courseName, Integer numOfTask)
	{
		this.courseName = courseName
		this.numOfTask = numOfTask
		taskName = new String[numOfTask]
		dueDate = new String[numOfTask]
	}
	// It assigns each task and duedate into the array
	Declare Public Void setTaskAndDue(String task, String due, Integer taskNum)
	{
		taskName[taskNum] = task 		
		dueDate[taskNum] = due
	}
	//It displays a collection of all information corresponding to a course 
	Declare Public Void displayCourseInfo()

		For (counter = 0 to counter < numOfTask, counter++)
		{
			Display taskName[counter]
			Display (“The due date is: “ , dueDate[counter])
		}
		
	}	

}

//This actually uses courseWork program as a data type for an array that is a data storage for course information

	at the same time.
