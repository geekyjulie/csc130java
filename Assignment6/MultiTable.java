   Write a program that prints a multiplication table, like this:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
   2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
   3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30

	    }
	    // after going through adding num value to temp value, the outer for loop will add 1 to the num
	    // value and the second row will be incremended as it was in the first row
